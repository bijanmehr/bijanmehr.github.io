I'm a mechatronics engineer and roboticist with a passion for solving complex, real-world engineering problems in creative ways using my expertise in systems design and engineering. My love of puzzles and challenges inspires me to explore the cutting-edge of hardware and software integration, particularly in the exciting field of cyber-physical systems. With a hacker mindset, I enjoy using unconventional methods to tackle tough problems, whether it's through AI and ML techniques, hardware hacking, or designing innovative tools and gadgets. I'm a firm believer in the power of open-source collaboration, and I love sharing my knowledge and experience with others. I'm a self-directed learner and thrive on mastering new skills and technologies. Right now, I'm eager to take my career to the next level by starting my PhD as soon as possible.
